# Clarity Apps #

A Repository of some demo apps built using my Clarity C++ web framework. This framework is currently a private repository but will be made public as soon as I can make sure the github security model does the things I need it to. I'm less concerned about this code here than I am about the main framework. Clarity itself is present here as a submodule though, so you can look at the code there.
